This is my lottery program. It will give you a prize if you guess either the number,
both of the digits but not in the right spot, or one of the digits.
First I get a random number 1-100 and then I ask the user for their guess.
Next I get both of the numbers by themselves. Then I tell the user the lottery number.
After that I go into a if statement to tell them if they got any of them right
First one is if they match both of the numbers and the spot there in.
If they don't get that it goes to if they got both the numbers but not in the right spot.
Next is if they got 1 of the numbers right and after that if they didn't get anything 
they don't win anything. So each of these if statements tell them what they won( or if they didn't win).
