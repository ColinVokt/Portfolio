This program takes a amount of money that the user inputed.
It will then divide it tell it gets it in quarters then dimes then nickels and then finally pennies.
So first I make my variables. Then I ask the user for the amount of money.
After that I divide it by 25 then by 10 then 5 then 1 for the amount of money.
Then finally tell them the amount of each.
