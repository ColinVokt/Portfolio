This program is a clock for our time zone.
First it takes the time in milliseconds then bringing down the number
to seconds then minutes then hours.
Then because the time you get is from a different time zone I subtract 6 hrs
from the clock giving you then time when you started the program
So its not the current time because it will always be a couple seconds off.
