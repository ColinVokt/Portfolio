The program takes 10 percent grades and then will take the average to give a grade.
So first I make my variables. After that I ask the user for their 10 grades.
After that it does the math by adding all the grades and dividing by 10.
After that it does a if/else/else statement to give you a letter grade based on the final percent
you got.
